Object Detection is the process of finding object instances like car, bus, bike, and humans in images or videos.


In this project, we use a pretrained model to predict 20 different objects in real-time.

How to run?

*python main.py --prototxt <=file path to Caffe ‘deploy’ prototxt file=> --model <=pretrained model path=> *

*termiate: press "esc"*
